## Homework 2 - Karan Kadakia - UIN: 655641760
- AWS login name: kkadak2
- Mapreduce deloyment on AWS EMR screen capture youtube link(done using Camatasia): <a href="https://youtu.be/47s6ruAdTNw" target="_blank"></a>


##IDE and Tools used:
Intellij, Cloudera VM, Eclipse(In Cloudera VM), sl4j, typesafe, AWS EMR, EC2, S3, Graphviz(http://viz-js.com/)


##Overall idea on how to run the project:
- Output generated by XMLParser project is input to MapReduce java project. 
- Output generated by MapReduce java project is input to a python script dotcode_script.py to generate the code in DOT format. 
- This DOT format code can be copy pasted on http://viz-js.com/


##Contents of the repository
- XMLParser - Parses the dblp XML file and stores the output in a txt file
- MapRed - MapReduce java project that I ran on cloudera VM
- Visualization_code - Contains the code that is used to do visualization on http://viz-js.com/ and an image of the visualization


##How to run the XMLParser
- Import the Java Project in the IDE
- Make sure the prof_name_list.txt file(File is present in XMLParser) is saved in the XMLParser folder. This file contains a list of the cs professor which is used to parse the dblp.xml file
- Output is saved programatically in author_pairs.txt file
- *dblp.xml and dblp.dtd have to be saved in the XMLParser folder*


##How to run the MapReduce code
- Import the folder MapRed in IDE
- Go to > Run configurations
- Provide the location of input and output file location in the Arguments
- input file is author_pairs.txt which is present in the folder MapRed
- Run the project
- Output file is generated in a folder named output.txt named "part-r-00000.txt"
- Output file is currently present in the project delete it before running the project

##How to perform Visualization
- Open the folder named "Visualization_code"
- This folder contains the text file named "part-r-00000.txt" which is the output of runnning MapReduce
- This output is converted to a DOT format using the python script named "dotcode_script.py"
- The output generated by the python script is saved in the file named "di_output.txt"
- The DOT format output(present in Visualization_code/di_output.txt) can be copy pasted on the website http://viz-js.com/ and the visualization can be seen on the right side
