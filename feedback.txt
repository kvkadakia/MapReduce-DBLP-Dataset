Hi Karan:
I received your submission - you put a serious effort in it and the result is good. It shows that you learned hands-one how to create mr applications using a nontrivial framework and you deployed your implementation on AWS EMR, or so you claim. Unfortunately, since no video proof is available, I cannot give you any bonus points. However, you wrote a sepatate python script for producing data for visualization, Now, I have some critical points for you - otherwise, my feedback would be empty :-).

1. Your code may have more informative comments and it is poorly commented in general. For example, when you say "in the arguments in eclipse..." I don't understand what it means. 
2. Your tests do not exist.
3. Your documentation is good, although I would prefer to see a more in-depth discussion of your design choices and limitations.

Despite all that, you have done a good job. Your grade is 3%.

Thank you,
Mark
